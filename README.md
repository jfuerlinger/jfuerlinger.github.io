# My personal blog titeled 'Hey Joe'

This blog describes my (sometimes very rocky) journey on the way to implementing my Homelab. I don't have any preferences, but rather put it together part by part and draw inspiration from various sources.

I describe the individual steps to reach my goal and also try to document the problems I encountered along the way, including the solution, as best I can. This serves as a reference for me, but also for anyone working on similar projects.
